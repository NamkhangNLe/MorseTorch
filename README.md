Morse Torch is a Swift-based iOS application designed to provide essential Morse code communication tools. Using advanced computer vision technology and state-of-the-art language processing, our app allows users to seamlessly communicate in Morse code. Whether you need to transmit messages in challenging situations or simply want to explore the world of Morse code, Morse Torch has you covered.

### Text-to-Morse Translator
Effortlessly convert your text messages into Morse code. Morse Torch ensures accurate translation for effective communication.

### Flashlight Flashing
Use our built-in flashlight capabilities to transmit Morse code signals visually. This feature is particularly useful in low-light conditions or emergencies.

### Morse Code-to-Text Converter
Harness the power of computer vision to decode Morse code from visual signals. Simply point your device's camera at the Morse code, and Morse Torch will translate it into readable text.

1. Enter text in the "Text to Morse" section.
2. Tap "Translate" to convert the text into Morse code.
3. Aim your device where you want to communicate and watch the magic happen.
5. For Morse-to-Text conversion, switch to the "Morse to Text" section.
6. Choose between recording a new video or uploading one you have made in the past.
7. In a few seconds, your translation will be available for viewing.

## In Action
Use your phone flashlight to reach first responders.
